# Quantized-Movement-Sequence
(Under Construction)

## Problem
Consider the common depiction of some integer vector in two dimensions beginning at the origin and terminating at some point (x, y). What we expect to see is a smooth, continuous directed line segment with a slope described by y/x. What if instead we consider what it would look like if we were limited to constructing a path between the origin in and the terminal by arranging the appropriate numbers of unit vectors tip to tail? Let's illustrate what we mean by an example.
